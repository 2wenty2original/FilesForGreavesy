open the .dds in a hex editor, scroll like 70-80% the way down.

this is where you will find mentions to GitHub file paths and "screenshots"

its one thing to have the file path to the GitHub you are currently working on, maybe that's from where I exported the .dds.

its another for it to have several other file paths for no reason with references to "screenshots" that do not exist in my folders
